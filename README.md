Welcome to Card Game!

This is my very first functional app on IOS using SwiftUI. 

About:
Welcome to my inaugural iOS app, the War Card Game, a thrilling creation using SwiftUI! As my first venture into iOS development, this app brings the classic card game to life in a digital format. Let's dive into the details of how it works and the unique features it offers.

Overview:
The War Card Game is a two-player card game where the goal is to win all the cards. The deck is split evenly between the players, and in each round, both players reveal the top card of their deck. The player with the higher-ranked card wins the round and takes both cards, adding them to the bottom of their deck. If there's a tie, it's time for WAR! Players place three cards face down, and the fourth card is compared to determine the winner.


Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: 
I've designed the app with SwiftUI, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing interface for a seamless and enjoyable user experience.
Gameplay Logic:
Players start with half of the deck each.
Cards are drawn from the top of the deck in each round.
The higher-ranked card wins the round.
In the event of a tie, a "War" is initiated, adding an extra layer of excitement.
Animated Card Interactions:
Experience engaging card animations, providing a dynamic and immersive gameplay environment.
Scorekeeping:
Keep track of the rounds won by each player with a scoring system I've implemented.


How It Works - Step by Step:

Launch the App:
Upon launching the app, you'll be greeted with a welcoming screen and a "Start Game" button.
Start the Game:
Tap "Start Game" to enter the game interface, where you'll see your deck and the opponent's deck.
Initiate Rounds:
Tap anywhere on the screen to reveal the top card of your deck and the opponent's deck simultaneously.
Determine the Winner:
The player with the higher-ranked card wins the round and collects both cards, placing them at the bottom of their deck.
War Scenario (Tie):
If there's a tie, a "War" is declared.
Three cards are placed face down, and the fourth card determines the winner of the War.
Scorekeeping:
The app keeps track of the rounds won by each player, displaying the score prominently.
End Game:
Continue playing until one player accumulates all the cards, becoming the ultimate winner.
